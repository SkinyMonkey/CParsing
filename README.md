CParsing
========

A simple recursive descent parser framework in C

At the beginning it was suppose to be used in parser generation.

This code was build so you can use it like some kind of BNF.

An example is in tests/test.c.

TODO
====

Correct names, cut the code to be less "generation oriented".
